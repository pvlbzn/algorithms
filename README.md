# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is about _Programs_ since `_Programs_ = Algorithms + Data Structures`,
as Niklaus Wirth wrote.

The code is organized into folders named after the language of implementation. Each folder
tries to be idiomatic in its language of implementation and ecosystem, however,
it is not the target itself. No implementation is production ready, despite that they developed in Test Driven Development manner. Production ready algorithms and data structures must be robust, generic, and be well protected from a fool. None of these is a target of this repository.


### Instructions

Each folder contains it's own `README.md` where all the information considering
running and testing is stated. Moreover, each source file has docstring with,
at least, some explanation.
